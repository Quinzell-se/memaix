"""One contract for running git against a memory vault.

Versioned memory is the product's central promise, and until now three
modules kept it three different ways. `memory_store._git_commit` returned a
hash it never checked, `pm._git_commit` returned a bool wrapped in a bare
`except Exception`, and `onboarding._git_commit` returned nothing at all.
None of them looked at a returncode.

That is not three implementations of one idea; it is three different
promises to the caller, and two of them promised nothing. In production
every git command had been failing with exit 128 -- the container ran as
root against vault directories owned by uid 1000, and git refuses to touch
a repository whose owner it doesn't recognise. Six of seven vaults held
zero commits. `memory_write` kept answering with an empty string where a
snapshot id belonged, and `memory_history` returned `[]` because it had the
production failure mode written into it as a fallback.

So: every command is checked, a failure carries git's own words, and
`commit()` refuses to hand back a hash it cannot prove exists. The one
non-failure that looks like a failure -- "nothing to commit", exit 1 --
is recognised explicitly rather than swallowed along with everything else.

Identity lives here too. A container has no `~/.gitconfig`, so
`user.name`/`user.email` are unset and `git commit` dies with "Author
identity unknown". `memory_store` passed identity through the environment
and the other two didn't, which means fixing only the ownership would have
left `pm_*` and onboarding broken in a new and equally quiet way.
